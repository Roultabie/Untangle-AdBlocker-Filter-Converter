Conversion script for Untangle Adblocker

Converts AdBlock Plus filter list to JSON format to be imported into Untangle
	* Downloads latest EasyList No Element Hide list
	* Strips out first line
	* Strips out lines with ! since they are comments
	* Strips out lines with @@ since they are pass rules
	* Remove everything to the right of $ since this is usually third-party or other
	  helpers
	* Remove empty lines
	* Remove the following # " ' [ ] ^ \n \t \r ||
	* Split the file into 2000 line chunks and dumps to a file

After lots of trial and error, it appears the way that Untangle AdBlocker works is that it
matches a filter rule to the URL of the web resource (page, css, js, image, etc.)  Only
the wild card * works.  Items found in the AdBlock Plus filter list (^, ||, $third-party,
etc.) don't work.

The script will automatically download https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist_noelemhide.txt
and store in the directory.  I chose this file because Untangle AdBlocker can't use the
element hide rules that AdBlock Plus uses.

Original script was downloaded from http://msimmons.ws/?p=142 which was based on work by
WebFooL http://forums.untangle.com/ad-blocker/29204-convert-adblock-plus-txt-file-json-format-2.html

I found the AdBlock Plus information here https://adblockplus.org/en/filters#options and
here https://adblockplus.org/en/filter-cheatsheet helpful.



Use the script and import at your own risk.  Currently if I import the output of this
script it blocks too much, but I haven't had time to investigate.
